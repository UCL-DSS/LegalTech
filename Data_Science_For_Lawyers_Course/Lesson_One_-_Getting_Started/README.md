# Data Science For Lawyers Workshops
Authors: Amanda Lim and Bhavya Gupta
Original Author: Wolfgang Alschner

##Introduction
Hi there! Welcome  to the Data Science For Lawyers Course. A team of dedicated students at the UCL Data Science Society have been working hard to provide accessible resources to learn data science specifically in the law field. LegalTech, or legal data science, has gained popularity over the years, and thus we wanted to provide a way for people with zero background in coding to learn some cool data science techniques applicable to law.

##What is legal data science?
Legal data science refers to harnessing the power of computer science and artificial intelligence to scale legal research by analyzing legal documents more efficiently and effectively. Data science can be used to handle and explore large amount of legal texts, finding information in unstructured text, automate legal document analysis through artificial intelligence, predict the outcome of court decisions, and much more!

#What does this course teach me?
This course teaches you how to utilise R, a programming language for data science, from scratch through an interactive learning environment. These lessons will teach you how to approach and solve big legal questions in a simple programming environment.


##Lessons Available
We will be releasing the lessons as we code them every ten days. If a lesson has not been coded yet, you will NOT be able to take it. If there is a new lesson, re-download this GitHub repository and follow the same steps under "How do I get started?"

Here is a list of lessons you can take now:
  Lesson One - Getting Started

Here is a list of lessons that will be released soon:
  Lesson Two – Webscraping and Data Upload
  Lesson Three – Regular Expressions
  Lesson Four – Citation Networks
  Lesson Five - Dictionary analysis
  Lesson Six - Similarity
  Lesson Seven – Automated Content Analysis Through Machine learning
  Lesson Eight – Prediction

##Disclaimer
These lessons are based on workshops original created by Wolfgang Alschner , a Professor at the University of Ottawa.

UCL Data Science Society does not take any credit for the creation of this material, except where additions/edits were made. Swirl integration and additional material and questions were created by Amanda Lim and  Bhavya Gupta as part of a project initiated by the UCL Data Science Society.
