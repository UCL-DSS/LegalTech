Hi!

Welcome  to the Data Science For Lawyers Course!
Legal data science has been gaining popularity over the years. 

What is legal data science? Well, it refers to harnessing the power of computer science and artificial intelligence to scale legal research by analyzing legal documents more efficiently and effectively. Data science can be used to handle and explore large amount of legal texts, finding information in unstructured text, automate legal document analysis through artificial intelligence, predict the outcome of court decisions, and much more! 

This course teaches you how to utilise R for data Science from scratch, and how to approach and solve big legal questions in a simple programming environment.

These lessons are based on workshops original created by Wolfgang Alschner , a Professor at the University of Ottawa. 

UCL Data Science Society does not take any credit for the creation of this material, except where additions/edits were made. Swirl integration, additional material and questions, as well as the Jupyter notebook were created by Amanda Lim, Bhavya Gupta, and Johann Ohler as part of a project initiated by the UCL Data Science Society.
